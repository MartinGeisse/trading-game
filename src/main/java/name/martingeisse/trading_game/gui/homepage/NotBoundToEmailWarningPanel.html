        Your current player (<span wicket:id="name"></span>) is not bound to any email address. To log in again, you
        must either bind it to an email address or note down its login token, which is
        <div style="margin: 20px; text-align: center; font-weight: bold; " wicket:id="loginToken"></div>
        Otherwise you will not be able to log in as that player again!
