        <h1>Bind Player To Email Address</h1>
        <p>Binding your player to an email address allows to log in again at any time, from any computer. Please
            enter your email address below. An email with a log-in link will be sent to that address which you can
            use to log in with your current player. Also, the last email address to which you sent the link will be
            remembered so you can re-send the link to that address even without having logged in.</p>
