    <p>This game is "paid" for in an unusual way: By offering computing time on your computer to Folding@Home, a
    medical research project that is in need of lots of computing power to better understand certain diseases. See
    their <a href="http://folding.stanford.edu">home page</a> for general information on the project and detailed
    information on how to contribute computing time.</p>
    <p>In the future, we expect the need to pay for playtime in a traditional way, using money, by players who cannot
        or don't want to deal with F@H, for example for technical reasons. This is planned long-term only, so please
        be patient. Payment will only affect playtime though, and never have any in-game effect:</p>
    <div class="container">
        <div class="jumbotron">
            <b>This game will never be pay-to-win, and any attempt to make it pay-to-win (such as selling in-game
            items for real money) is prohibited. </b>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p>Furthermore, I really want to keep the F@H "payment" up long-term because I like the idea. So if you want to
        continue playing without paying, you can. You should expect the "price" in terms of F@Å“H credits needed for
        playtime to rise in the future, though.
