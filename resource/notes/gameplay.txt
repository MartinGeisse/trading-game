	interesting to stop ships from being essentially worthless."
	- "Having a crew slowly level up would be cool too. This game is already complicated. No one would mind if we added
		more depth to it."

- "building up close relationships with miners can be a massive advantage in the T1 manufacturing world as discounts

- (broker's fee + sales tax) beim Verkaufen von Items
- "To increase your profits you can build frequently used T1 drones and ammo and move it to mission hubs, it may take a
	bit longer to sell but you will see a greatly increase profit margin. Knowing where to sell is just as important as
	knowing how to build"
- "Selling a wide variety of T1 goods in low-sec can net you a good profit. Because supply is so limited in low sec,
	you can easily charge a hefty margin. The only problem is the lack of demand, which means you can easily saturate
	your market if you pump too much money into the system. Also, GETTING your goods to low sec can be very dangerous."
- "The main problem facing T1 manufacturing are tight, or non-existent margins. It goes to show, then, that the cheaper
	you get your minerals for, the higher your profits you can expect to see. Try to convince people into selling you
	their minerals for less than they are actually worth. This could be scamming, or finding mineral suppliers who are
	unable/too lazy to do their own hauling. This could also mean finding undervalued ore and refining it for profit."
